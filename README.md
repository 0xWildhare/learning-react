#Widgets App

learned a lot of react stuff that I will definitely forget quickly if i don't put it into practice. If I were smart, I would go through and comment the hell out of it so that I can have notes on what everything does. I probably wont do that though, as I want to maintain my forward progress. Also, I am not going to deploy this, as one of the API keys will break if its run anywhere other than localhost:3000.

btw if you are reading this, who the hell are you and why?
